                <h2>Trauma Therapy</h2>
                <p>A Trauma-Informed Care approach strives to understand the whole
                    <br>of an individual who is seeking services.
                    When trauma occurs, <br> it affects an individual's sense of self,
                    their sense of others <br> and their beliefs about the world.
                    These beliefs <br> can directly impact an individual's <br>ability or
                    motivation to connect
                    with and utilize support services.
                    <br> A system utilizing a Trauma-Informed Care approach realizes the
                    direct impact
                    that<br> trauma can have on access to services and responds by
                    changing policies,
                    procedures and <br>practices to minimize potential barriers. A system
                    utilizing a
                    Trauma-Informed approach <br> also fully integrates knowledge about
                    trauma into all aspects of
                    services and trains staff<br> to recognize the signs and symptoms of
                    trauma
                    and thus avoid any possibility of re-traumatization.

                        <p>Family therapy is a type of psychological counseling
                            (psychotherapy) that can help family
                            members improve communication and resolve conflicts.

                            Family therapy is usually provided by a psychologist, clinical
                            social worker or licensed
                            therapist. These therapists have graduate or postgraduate
                            degrees and may be credentialed by
                            the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy
                            (AAMFT)

                            Family therapy is often short term. It may include all family
                            members or just those able or
                            willing to participate. Your specific treatment plan will
                            depend on your family's situation.
                            Family therapy sessions can teach you skills to deepen family
                            connections
                            and get through stressful times, even after you're done going
