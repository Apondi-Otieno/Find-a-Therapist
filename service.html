                <h2>Trauma Therapy</h2>
                <p>A Trauma-Informed Care approach strives to understand the whole
                    <br>of an individual who is seeking services.
                    When trauma occurs, <br> it affects an individual's sense of self,
                    their sense of others <br> and their beliefs about the world.
                    These beliefs <br> can directly impact an individual's <br>ability or motivation to connect
                    with and utilize support services.
                    <br> A system utilizing a Trauma-Informed Care approach realizes the direct impact
                    that<br> trauma can have on access to services and responds by changing policies,
                    procedures and <br>practices to minimize potential barriers. A system utilizing a
                    Trauma-Informed approach <br> also fully integrates knowledge about trauma into all aspects of
                    services and trains staff<br> to recognize the signs and symptoms of trauma
                    and thus avoid any possibility of re-traumatization.</p>

                            but they all have the same goal: to improve or enhance the relationship.
                            The term <br>“relationship therapy (or counseling)” refers to therapy with adults in
                            romantic<br> relationships, although there are certainly other relationships that therapy

                        <p>Family therapy is a type of psychological counseling (psychotherapy) that can help family
                            members improve communication and resolve conflicts.

                            Family therapy is usually provided by a psychologist, clinical social worker or licensed
                            therapist. These therapists have graduate or postgraduate degrees and may be credentialed by
                            the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT)

                            Family therapy is often short term. It may include all family members or just those able or
                            willing to participate. Your specific treatment plan will depend on your family's situation.

                            and get through stressful times, even after you're done going to therapy sessions.</p>
